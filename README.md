# OScript

OScript is a repository containing Operating System assignments and projects. It includes coding solutions in multiple languages and provides a structured way to explore OS concepts practically.

## Repository Contents

### 1. Assignments
- The repository includes given assignments in PDF format.
- Assignments cover topics such as:
  - Shell scripting
  - Process management
  - Memory management
  - Input/Output operations
  - File system management
  - Process scheduling
  
### 2. Programming Solutions
- The assignments include code implementations in the following languages:
  - **Shell Scripting**
  - **C**
  - **C++**
  - **Java**
- The scripts and programs demonstrate OS-related concepts, including process creation, synchronization, inter-process communication, and scheduling.

### 3. Project
- A separate PDF includes a project with 5 key questions:
  - Process Synchronization
  - Deadlocks
  - Multithreading
  - Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
  - Virtual Memory and Paging
